For my final project, I would like to create a website, CarGuide, which displays some information about a variety of incredible cars. The data I would need is a picture, video, make/model, top speed, short description, and price for each car I include. I will use the YouTube API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to pull the videos of the cars, as these would be very inefficient to store locally. The website might include a home page, which includes a bit of all the following as well as an about section, an "All Cars" page, which users could use to see all of the cars in my website, with functions to perhaps filter the cars by the available data, and a blog page, similar to the Adopt-A-Dog blog page from the last HTML class. The reason I want to create this website is I'm very interested in cool cars. With this website, I could create a convenient way to share my passion of cars with others (especially with the blog) in a cool and hopefully practical way.
